The book opens with the story of Bach's Musical Offering. Bach made an impromptu visit to King Frederick the Great
of Prussia, and was requested to improvise upon a theme presented by the King. His improvisations formed the basis
of that great work. The Musical Offering and its story form a theme upon which I "improvise"

throughout the book, thus making a sort of "Metamusical Offering". Self-reference and the interplay between
different levels in Bach are discussed: this leads to a discussion of parallel ideas in Escher's drawings and
then Gödel’s Theorem. A brief presentation of the history of logic and paradoxes is given as background for Gödel’s
Theorem. This leads to mechanical reasoning and computers, and the debate about whether Artificial Intelligence is
possible. I close with an explanation of the origins of the book-particularly the why and wherefore of the
Dialogues.

Three-Part Invention.
Bach wrote fifteen three-part inventions. In this three-part Dialogue, the Tortoise and Achilles-the main fictional
protagonists in the Dialogues-are "invented" by Zeno (as in fact they were, to illustrate Zeno's paradoxes
of motion). Very short, it simply gives the flavor of the Dialogues to come.

A simple formal system (the MIL'-system) is presented, and the reader is urged to work out a puzzle to gain
familiarity with formal systems in general. A number of fundamental notions are introduced: string, theorem,
axiom, rule of inference, derivation, formal system, decision procedure, working inside/outside the system.

Two-Part Invention.
Bach also wrote fifteen two-part inventions. This two-part Dialogue was written not by me,
but by Lewis Carroll in 1895. Carroll borrowed Achilles and the Tortoise from Zeno, and I in turn
borrowed them from Carroll. The topic is the relation between reasoning, reasoning about reasoning, reasoning
about reasoning about reasoning, and so on.
